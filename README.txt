This is the repository for code related to OSU CS 361 Summer 2021.
My current project idea is to create an app that allows the user to select an ailment or issue they want to address and brings them to a
page with information on various essential oils that could address their problems. The essential oil page will pull information from
Wikipedia or similiar and provides recommendations on how to use the essential oil. There is also a review section with the ability to 
allow users to offer advice on essential oils, combinations, and efficacy. There may also be purchase links or recommendations.
